# java-exercises Part 2

I'm solving the exercises inspired from the MOOC from the second part of the University of Helsinki's java course. 

In solving this exercises I'm using JDK 11.0.3, Maven 3.6.0 (in order to get used to it once I'll learn to build bigger projects) and VS Code as an IDE (planning to switch to NetBeans or Intellij in a couple of weeks).

To run an App navigate to its target/classes folder then run java com.vanny96.App

e.g. for linux:

    $ cd java-exercises
    $ cd name/target/classes
    $ java com.vanny96.App
